# C# Source Code
In this repository, you can find all the source code written and developed by me (SalamM1/Salamencemaster1). You will NOT find any Unity plugins, unity files, media assets, etc. This is ONLY for the scripting, and only what is written by me. This will be updated periodically as the game is developed over time. There is no strict update schedule since this is being developed in my free time. Additionally, this repository is only used as a second form of backup and a source to view scripts. The project is updated via Unity Collab, where the updates are smaller and more consistent.

### Assets Used in Project
